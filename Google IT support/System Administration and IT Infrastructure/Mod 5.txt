Data recovery
    The process of trying to restore data after an expected event that results in data loss or corruption

The best way to be prepared for data-loss event is to have a well thought-out Disaster plan and procedure
Disaster plan and procedure:
    involve making regular backups of any and all critical data that's necessary for your ongoing business
     processes.
    critical data involves customer data, system databases, system conflicts, and financial data

Post mortem
    you might discover issues when recovering your data that wasn't covered in the disaster plan. 
    A post mortem is a way for you to document any problems you discovered along the way, and 
    most importantly, the ways you fixed them so you can make sure they dont happen again

Factors to consider for a backup
    Data thats absolutely neccessary for operation  and can be found in another source
    ○ Email database, Sales database, financial spreadsheets, server configs, and databases.
    ○ Account for future growth of data and choose a solution that is flexible enough to easily 
        accomodate increases in data backups
    ○ Local backups to systems on-site or off-site on remote systems
        On-site or self-manages backups could be as simple as buying a commercial NAS device, loading it 
        with a bunch of hard drives and sending data to it over the network.
        both onsite and off site can be implemented depending on your organizations budget
    ○ Evaluate the backup time period. How long do you need to hang onto backups for?

Backup tools
    ○ command line tool Rsync 
    ○ Time machine for Mac OS
    ○ backup and restore by Microsoft

Testing backups
    Restoring procedure should be documented and accessible so that anyone with the right access can restore
    operations when needed.
    Regularly test the documentation procedure to make sure it works now and in the future.
    This process is called Disaster Recovery Testing. at least once a year

Disaster Recovery plan
    A collection of documented procedures and plans on how to react and handle an emergency or disaster 
    scenario, from the operational perspective.
    This includes things to be done before, during and after a disaster.
    ***Covers detection and preventive measures
    Preventive measures - any procedures or systems in place that will proactively minimize the impact of a 
    disaster

    Detection meaasures - meant to alert you and your team that a disaster has occured that can impact operations

    Corrective or recovery measures - those enacted after a disaster has occured
    When one system in a redundant pair suffers a failure, its called a single point of failure. 

    Three types of measures in a disaster recovery plan
        ○ Risk Assessement - allows to prioritize certain aspects of the organization that are at more risk.

        ○ Determine Backup and Recovery Systems - make sure you ahve a sounnd backup and a recovery system 
        along with a good strategy
        Redundancy should not be limited to only systems, anything critcal to operations should be made 
        redundant whenever possible e.g. power delivery - or supply, communicaton systems, data links and hardware
        #call rautive
        operational documantation on all procedures. 

        ○ Determine Detection & Alert measures & Test systems in place that can quickly detect and alert you 
        to service outages or abnormal environmental conditions
        temperature,CPU loadd, network load, for service monitoring for error ratesand requests per second will 
        give you insight into performance of the system.
        
        ○ Determine recovery measures

What's a Post mortem
    We create a post mortem after accident , an outage, or some event when something goes wrong, or 
    at the end of a project to analyze how it went.
    INCLUDES - 
    ○ A brief summary
        what the incident was
        How long it lasted
        What the impact was
        How it was fixed.
        #Note be mindful of time zones when listing time and dates in a post mortem
    ○ A detailed timeline of key events - actions taken before, during and after
        involves everthing that happened throughout the event like
        When it started
        When people involved were notified or realized what was going on
        Every action taken in an attempt to resolve the situation
    ○ A very detailed and honest account of the ROOT CAUSE is covered
        What led to the issue
    ○ A more detailed explanation of the RESOLUTION and RECOVERY EFFORTS should be document next
    ○ Lastly close out the report with a list of SPECIFIC ACTIONS that should be taken to avoid 
        the same scenario from happening again.
        includes any actions or efforts aimed at improving the response handling too
        What went well
