DIRECTORY services
 contains a lookup service that provides mapping between network resources and their network addresses

 should support replication 
    improves redundancy and decreases latency
 uses a hierarchical model of objects amd containers(organizational units)

 sysadmin is responsible for 
    ○ setup
    ○ configuration
    ○ maintenance

DAP Directory Access Protocol 
DSP Disrectory System Protocol 
DISP Directory Information Shadowing Protocol
DOBMP Directory Operational Bindings Management Protocol
LIDP Lightweight Directory Access protocol

CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    a central service that provides instructions to all of the different parts of my
    IT infrastructure

    services provided for Directory services are centralized authentication, authorisation and accounting AAA


    the use of log on scripts which run everytime someone log onto a computer

LDAP
    add, remove or modify entries in a directory
    BIND operation which authenticates clients to the directory server.

    3 common ways to authenticate
    ○ anonymous - anyone can acces (open)
    ○ simple - can be accesed with directory name and passsword but done with plain text and not secured(encryption)
    ○ SASL simple authentication and security layer - employs security protocol like TLS 
        uses methods such as kerberos for authentication

Active Directory introduced with Windows server 2000
    ☼ Domain the highest node on the directory server tree
    #A Forest contains one or more domains
        ☼ Computers
        ☼ Domain controllers - servers that holds copies the Active Directory database 
                also serve as DNS to provide name resolution and service discovery to clients
                They provide central authentication through a network security protocol called Kerberos
        ☼ Users
            Domain Admins - group for Admins
            Enterprise Admins - also admins of the active directory domain. Also have a permission to
                make changes to the doamin that affect other domains in a multi domian forest
            Domain Users - contains every Users
            Domain Computers - contains all computer sjoined on the domain except domain controllers

            SAM - Security Account Manager is a database in Windows that stores usernames and passwords
            

        Group category and Group Scope 
        category
            Security - used to grant or deny access to IT resources
            Distribution - only designed to group accounts and contacts foor email commuuniction
        scope has to do with the way group definitions are replicated across domains
        #keeping a lot of large groups synchronized in a very large network is complicated
            Domain Local - used to assign permission to a resources
            Global - Used to group accounts into a role e.g. researchers group
            Universal - used to group roles in a forest. It gets replicated across multidomain forests
        
        for GPO management we use GPMC found under the tools group of server or by running  gpmc.msc
